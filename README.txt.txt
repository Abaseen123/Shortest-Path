Shortest Path:

Either using an input file or using your own words in the terminal, 
you will compile the program then run it, and this program should return 
the shortest number of countries that is linked with other countries by
the first letter of their name. So for example,

Canada -> United States -> Algeria ->Angola ->Azerbaijan,

will return 2 countries becuase Canada -> Azerbaijan.

HAVE FUN.
